## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- MongoDB (Local instance or MongoDB Atlas cluster)
- Cloudinary Account (required for image processing and storage)

### Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayoitssmit/MainBranch.git
   cd fsd-project
   ```

2. **Setup the Backend Server**
   Navigate to the server directory and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and configure the following required environment variables:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
   ```

   Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Setup the Frontend Client**
   Open a secondary terminal window, navigate to the client directory, and install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

   Create a `.env.local` file in the `client` directory and configure the endpoints:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

   Start the client application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the Application**
   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. The backend API is hosted concurrently on `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Documentation

- `/api/auth`: User authentication, login, and registration.
- `/api/users`: Profile data, portfolio items, and platform statistics.
- `/api/posts`: Social feed management, posts creation, likes, and comments.
- `/api/chat`: Real-time secure messaging and history fetching.
- `/api/notifications`: System alerts and interaction notifications.
- `/api/upload`: Endpoints handling direct image uploads via Cloudinary.
